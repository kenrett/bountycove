== Dev BootCamp Final project

Bounty Cove focuses on a fun, interactive way to teach children the importance of financial responsibility. We created an app that invites parents to prepare a list of every day tasks, Quests, that they would like their children to complete. A child logs into their parent created account, and can see the value of each task along with a list of treasures that they can purchase with their accrued "doubloons" (Pirate money). Children are also welcome to add "wish list" items that a parent can choose to include or not.
