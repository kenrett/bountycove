== Dev BootCamp Final project

A six-day project built from scratch. The idea of the project was to create an interactive way to make chores fun for kids using a pirate theme. Parents can sign up and prepare a list of every day tasks that their children can complete. Each task completed will reward the child with some "doubloons", which can then be exchanged for rewards created by the parents.
